# School

## High School
I attended Southlake Carroll for my entire K-12 education and met some of my closest friends. I have broken down my reflections each year, starting with COVID-19 and ending with graduation. I believe I was a successful student, and my time in high school was well spent.

### Freshman Year
Covid-19 hit pretty hard and caused me to stay in my room for the majority of the time. I got really into [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/turtlecap1324) with my favorite shows being Your Lie in April, Code Geass, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. I look back at this year positively, as I had lots of free time and often spent it watching anime or playing video games with my friends.

Created a "Nanoleaf" knockoff using an Arduino, WS2812B LEDs, and a [3D-printed light panel.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4686921)

### Sophomore Year
This year was very hectic, with lots of changes in friendships. I can only recall the time I went to BPA nationals and helped my friends with computer science in AP Computer Science A. This year is a blur, but I remember getting into the gym and trying to bulk up starting in December 2022.

Picked this off the side of the road and have kept it since.

Also went to Disney World while I was in the band program playing alto sax.

### Junior Year
This year was extremely hectic, and I got into buying "shoes" for my friends and me.

<Image src={Shoes} alt="Shoes" width={500} className="center-image" />

I also moved a few friend groups and ultimately stuck with this one for a long time. My physique got better, and I continued working out while maintaining a good diet. The SAT was not the biggest priority to me, and I was ultimately happy with my final score around the 1500 range. I was hoping to go to Brown, Georgia Tech, or Purdue... I was very hopeful.

<Image src={UW} alt="Shoes" width={500} className="center-image" />


Toured the University of Washington with my family, and though I disliked the cold and I would drag on about how much I wanted to stay in the southern warmth... the campus kept up on me, and I could see myself at that school. I enjoyed the nature, the quiet but bustling campus, and the massive campus.

### Senior Year
Once again, I found another group of friends whom I latched onto, where I found myself playing lots of poker and Valorant as well as playing Hypixel Skyblock once again... I had done robotics in junior year but this year I had a very good team and we traveled to many places and ultimately made it to the world championship. I also participated in [HackUTD](https://devpost.com/software/homeready-pro) as well as [AIFAHacks](https://devpost.com/software/paveguard).

When dropping my sister off at the UW campus, I felt as if I could see myself on the campus, and I was excited to apply for computer science, which ultimately was the reason why I did not get in due to the abysmally low 2% acceptance rate :').

That was not the only school I was rejected from, but I got rejected from a multitude of schools and have summarized them in a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1bfxkpp/college_results_2028/). I ultimately got into Northeastern University, which I toured, and although it is not as big as the University of Washington campus, I am glad to have the opportunity to study here.

I graduated high school and worked at a Malaysian restaurant for the rest of the summer while preparing for the move to... LONDON??!?!. I did not go directly to the Boston campus but rather went to London for my first semester and Oakland for my second semester.

## College
### London
I started college in London, and I experienced a very different change of pace from high school. In high school, I was quiet and reserved, and I felt that I should make a change in college so I decided to put myself out there and I met some of my best friends. During my second week in London, I went to the club and did not end up back at my residence hall. ðŸ˜….

</div>

The next few weeks were hectic as I would explore London with friends, go to clubs on the weekends, and travel on the breaks. I visited Paris during my midterm week.

I visited Barcelona, Portugal, and Morocco during my Thanksgiving break.

I enjoyed my first semester, and that is when I migrated my portfolio from ReactJS to NextJS. London was a great opportunity and extremely fun, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to study there. If anyone has questions about the program, feel free to email me; I would love to talk about my time in London.

### Oakland
date: 04-14-2025

My second semester was in Oakland, California. I enjoyed the quietness of the campus, though I was initially concerned about the safety due to the location. My friend group did not really change, but my activities were more mellow as we did not go to the club as much and instead played field games such as Spikeball or soccer to pass time. 

I started to go back to the gym as the campus life was very slow and I had a lot of free time. 

I often went to San Francisco on the weekends, and it fascinated me how many tech ads were present. Rather than seeing ads for stores or for different places to eat, I saw ads on building LLMs and garnering training data.

I visited Yosemite and Monterey during my time in Oakland. 

#### Yosemite

Yosemite was great; we did a few hikes, but in particular the Mist Trail which was iced over, so it was quite scary getting to the top. I hope to go back and do the Half Dome hike.

#### Monterey

Monterey was part of a school-sponsored trip, and we visited the aquarium as well as the beach. It was nice because we were given full-size beds and the food was sponsored.

#### Spring break

Over spring break I went home to Texas and visited my friends at their respective schools (Rice, UT Austin, and Texas A&M). I also took the train from Oakland to Washington to visit my sister.

Overall, I enjoyed my time in Oakland. The teachers were wonderful, especially [Professor Spertus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Spertus). I am excited for Boston, especially the school clubs.


### First Year Reflections
My first year of college can be summed up as growthful. I learned a decent amount in school, though I wish it were more (not surprising since these were beginner classes), but I learned more about myself and the group I fit into. I went into college thinking I'd be relatively reserved and not go to clubs or pubs, but after my first year, I am more talkative, and I grew in confidence. My biggest change would be emotionally; I feel more emotional, and my highs are higher and lows are lower, which I believe is a good trait for anyone to have, as it lets you live in the moment. I have started to read more, and it may sound silly, but I have shifted music tastes. I initially enjoyed rap and could never see myself listening to artists such as Taylor Swift; however, I am now an "avid listener" to her music. Changes like this are small, but I believe that is the point of college: to change and find out who you are regardless of public perception. As of the end of my freshman year in college, I often phrase my career outlook as goes, "if I were smarter, I would want to be a quant, but I am not, so I hope to go into investment banking. I have no connections in that field so I will probably go into consulting".
