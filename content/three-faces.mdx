# Three faces
<center>A japanese saying is that we all have 3 differents faces, or more specifically 3 version of ourself :</center>

<center>"The first one you show to the world, the second you show to your family, and the last you never show to anyone"</center>

If you were to ask me, I would probably remark my 3 faces as the 3 men from the movie, 3 Idiots.
