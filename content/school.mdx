# School

## High School
I went to Southlake Carroll for my entire K-12 and met some of my closest friends. I have broken down my reflection of each year starting from covid to graduation. I like to think that I was a successful student and that my time in high school was spent well.

### Freshman Year
Covid-19 hit pretty hard and caused me to stay in my room for a majority of the time. I got really into [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/turtlecap1324) with my favorite shows being Your Lie in April, Code Geass, and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. I look back at this year positively as I had lots of free time and often spent that watching anime or playing video games with my friends.

Created "Nanoleaf" knock off using an Arduino, WS2812B LEDs, and a [3d Printed Light Panel](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4686921)

### Sophomore Year
This year was very hectic with lots of changes in friendships and I can only recall the time I went to BPA nationals and helping my friends with computer science in AP Computer Science A. This year is a blur but I remember getting into the gym and trying to bulk up starting in December 2022.

Picked this off the side of the road and have kept it since.

Also went to Disney World while I was was in the band program playing alto sax.

### Junior Year
This year is extremely hectic where I got into buying "shoes" for my friends and I.

I also moved a few friend groups and ultimately stuck with this one for a long time. My physique got better and I continued working out while maintaining a good diet. The SAT was not the biggest priority to me and I was ultimately happy with my final score around the 1500 range. I was hoping to go to a Brown, Georgia Tech, or Purdue... I was very hopeful.

Toured the University of Washington with my family and though I disliked the cold and I would drag on about how much I wanted to stay in the southern warmth... the campus kept up on me and I could see myself at that school. I enjoyed the nature, the quiet but bustling campus, and the massive campus.

### Senior Year
Once again found another group of friends whom I latched onto where I found myself playing lots of poker and Valorant as well as playing Hypixel Skyblock once again... I had done robotics in junior year but this year I had a very good team and we traveled to many places and ultimately made it to the world championship. I also participated in [HackUTD](https://devpost.com/software/homeready-pro) as well as [AIFAHacks](https://devpost.com/software/paveguard).

When dropping my sister off at the UW campus, I felt as if I could see myself on the campus and I was excited to apply for computer science which ultimately was the reason why I did not get in due to the abysmally low 2% acceptance rate :').

That was not the only school I was rejected from but I got rejected from a multitude of schools and have summarised them in a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1bfxkpp/college_results_2028/). I ultimately got into Northeastern University to which I toured and although it is not as big as the University of Washington campus, I am glad to have the opportunity to study here.

I graduated high school and worked at a Malaysian restaurant for the rest of summer while preparing for the move to... LONDON??!?!. I did not go directly to the Boston campus but rather went to London for my first semester and Oakland for my second semester.
