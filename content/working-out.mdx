# Working Out

## When and How I got started
I got started in December of 2021 where I weighed in at 125 pounds and was 5'7~
I realized that I had to make some sort of a change to my body or lifestyle so I could stay comfortable with my own body. 

I originally started working out in my home gym as I bought an adjustable set of dumbells and I used an old coffee table as my "bench".
My original split is as follows:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Body Part</th>
            <th>Exercises</th>
            <th>Days</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Arms</td>
            <td>Bicep curls, hammer curls, close-arm push ups</td>
            <td>M, W, F</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Back and chest</td>
            <td>Wide push ups, dumbell row, pull ups</td>
            <td>T, TH</td>
        </tr>
                <tr>
            <td>Legs</td>
            <td>Stationary bike</td>
            <td>Sat, Sun</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

This split was very inefficient and I never pushed myself to failure so I did not gain much muscle. 

For my 17th birthday I got a bench press so I was able to adjust my split by adding incline dumbell bench press as well as dumbell incline row.

## Going to a gym

I started sneaking into my local gym in April of 2022 using my mom's gym card. 

I changed my split to the following:


<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Body Part</th>
            <th>Exercises</th>
            <th>Days</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Back<br /><br />Bicep</td>
            <td>Lat pull down (drop set), Seated cable row, Machine rows<br /><br />
            Dumbbell twisting bicep curl (drop set), Cable bicep curl, Preacher curls</td>
            <td>M, W</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chest<br /><br />Tricep</td>
            <td>Chest press machine (drop set), Barbell Bench press, Wide push ups<br /><br />
            Tricep push down (drop set), Dumbbell triecp press</td>
            <td>T, TH</td>
        </tr>
                <tr>
            <td>Legs<br /><br />Shoulder</td>
            <td>Leg press, Leg extensions, Leg curl<br /><br />
            Dumbbell front raise, Dumbell shoulder press</td>
            <td>F</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

This split got me to failure but I believe I had too much volume such as adding dropsets and super sets. 

In this time I also got into deadlifting and even though my numbers were very low (275 pounds) but it was fun to go to the gym with friends and be obnoxious teenagers in the gym.

I still gained lots of progress and went from 125 pounds to 133 pounds. I kept this schedule for a long time until the winter of 2023 where I changed my split once again as I started going to the gym with friends.

I have been following this split since the winter of 2023 and I have gained 10 pounds where I hover around 140 pounds. My body fat was "measured" at 8% but I believe that is incorrect and I see myself at 12-15% body fat.

When I went started working my server job at the restaurant I had less time and ate worse so I stopped going to the gym and subsequently lost 10 pounds and going to London was even worse where I burned lots of muscle and came back looking "different" to my friends.

I am currently trying to get back into the gym and I am trying to get back to 140 pounds. I am currently at 138 pounds. I have attached photos from start to end of my journey below, click on the censored image to see the uncensored image.
